# EliteTutors - Teacher Self-Management Feature Plan

## 1. Goal
Enable teachers to register, log in, and manage their own profiles and content on the EliteTutors platform, including their personal information, subjects taught, availability, and administrative notes.

## 2. Scope
This feature will allow teachers to:
- Register for a teacher account.
- Log in to a dedicated teacher dashboard.
- Edit their personal profile information (name, contact, bio, etc.).
- Manage their subjects and educational levels.
- Update their availability for sessions.
- View administrative notes or feedback from platform administrators.
- Upload and manage study resources (future enhancement).
- Integrate WhatsApp contact link.

## 3. Phases

### Phase 1: Planning and Design (Current)
- Define API endpoints for teacher registration, login, profile management.
- Design database schema for teacher-specific data.
- Outline frontend UI/UX for teacher dashboard and profile editing.
- Plan for secure authentication and authorization for teachers.

### Phase 2: Backend Development
- Create Flask API endpoints for:
    - Teacher registration (`POST /api/teachers/register`)
    - Teacher login (`POST /api/teachers/login`)
    - Teacher profile retrieval (`GET /api/teachers/profile`)
    - Teacher profile update (`PUT /api/teachers/profile`)
    - Teacher availability management (`PUT /api/teachers/availability`)
    - Teacher administrative notes retrieval (`GET /api/teachers/admin-notes`)
- Implement JWT-based authentication for teachers.
- Extend existing database models or create new ones for teacher-specific data (e.g., `Teacher` model).
- Ensure proper data validation and error handling.

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
- Create a new React application or extend the existing main frontend for teachers.
- Develop:
    - Teacher registration page.
    - Teacher login page.
    - Teacher dashboard (overview of their profile, upcoming sessions, etc.).
    - Teacher profile editing page.
    - Availability management interface.
    - Display area for administrative notes.
    - Integration of WhatsApp link on their public profile.

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing
- Connect the new teacher frontend with the backend API.
- Implement secure authentication flow for teachers.
- Thoroughly test all teacher-facing functionalities (registration, login, profile updates, availability).
- Conduct end-to-end testing to ensure seamless user experience.
- Test security measures (e.g., unauthorized access attempts).

### Phase 5: Deployment and Documentation
- Deploy the updated backend API.
- Deploy the new or updated teacher frontend.
- Update main platform to link to teacher registration/login.
- Provide comprehensive documentation for teachers on how to use their dashboard.
- Update overall system documentation.

## 4. Technical Considerations

### Backend
- **Authentication**: Re-use JWT token mechanism, but with a separate token type or scope for teachers.
- **Database**: Add fields to existing `User` model or create a new `Teacher` model with fields like `bio`, `subjects_taught`, `availability_schedule`, `admin_notes`, `whatsapp_number`.
- **API Security**: Ensure teacher-specific endpoints are protected and only accessible by authenticated teachers.

### Frontend
- **Routing**: Implement new routes for teacher-specific pages (e.g., `/teacher/register`, `/teacher/login`, `/teacher/dashboard`, `/teacher/profile/edit`).
- **UI Components**: Re-use existing UI components (e.g., forms, buttons, cards) where possible for consistency.
- **State Management**: Use React Context or Redux for managing teacher authentication state and profile data.

## 5. WhatsApp Link and Administrative Description

### WhatsApp Link
- **Backend**: Add a `whatsapp_number` field to the `Teacher` model.
- **Frontend (Teacher Profile)**: Display a button on the public teacher profile page that links to `https://wa.me/<whatsapp_number>`.
- **Frontend (Teacher Dashboard)**: Allow teachers to input/update their WhatsApp number.

### Administrative Description (Notes)
- **Backend**: Add an `admin_notes` field to the `Teacher` model (text field).
- **Backend (Admin API)**: Only administrators should be able to write/update this field via the admin interface.
- **Frontend (Teacher Dashboard)**: Display this field as read-only for teachers.
- **Frontend (Public Teacher Profile)**: Decide if this should be publicly visible or only for internal use. (Initial decision: Internal use only, not public).

## 6. Milestones
- Plan completed (Current)
- Backend API for teachers developed
- Teacher frontend developed
- Integration and testing complete
- Deployment and documentation complete

This plan will guide the implementation of the teacher self-management feature, ensuring a secure and functional experience for teachers on the EliteTutors platform.
